                                    <p>Quartz as a material has been used in sandpaper, radar and soap.
                                        Since antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals
                                        in the making of jewellery and hardstone carvings, especially in Europe and the
                                        Middle East. </p>
                                    <p>They are used in electronics to transfer mechanical energy into an electrical

                                        silicon.</p>
                                    <p>Quartz is also used to make many computer components!</p>

                                <p>High heat can cause aquamarine to permanently change colors from sea foam green to
                                    light blue. Sky blue aquamarine is very popular, so most commercial aquamarine is
                                    heat treated to meet consumer demand for this beautiful blue gem.</p>
                                <p>The largest aquamarine weighs 10,363 carats! Which was located at the Smithsonian
                                    Museum, discovered in 1980</p>

                                <p>When observed with a magnifying loupe, fake crystals often show air bubbles from
                                    plastic, resin, or glass trapped inside the stone.</p>
                                <p>Natural crystals and stones are far less fragile than synthetic ones. </p>
                                <p>Real crystals should feel cold to the touch. They'll warm up when they sit against
                                    your skin for a while, but they won't retain that heat for long. Fake crystals often
                                    match the ambient room temperature or feel lukewarm.</p>

                                <p>A diamond over one carat in weight is one in a million.</p>
                                <p>The word diamond derives from the Greek word 'adamas' meaning indomitable and
                                    invincible, a fitting name for the hardest natural substance on earth. There is
                                    nothing that can scratch a diamond except another diamond. </p>

                                <p>The word jewel derives from the old French word 'jouel', which translates directly as
                                    a play thing, or toy. </p>
                                <p>This is predominantly down to the fact that only wealthy people could afford
                                    jewellery, and so they referred to them as toys. </p>
                                <p>Synthetic diamonds, chemically identical to organic ones but more affordable, have
                                    been produced since the 1950s, offering an ethical and cost-effective alternative to
                                    mined diamonds by expediting the diamond formation process in a high-pressure,
                                    high-heat lab environment.</p>

                                    beauty. Offering a diamond pendant is a strong gesture, synonymous with constancy,
                                    attachment and immortality.</p>
                                <p>More than just an accessory, jewelry can also be a symbol of power and status. Women
                                    have worn jewelry for many years to show how important or wealthy they are. Today,
                                    jewelry can still be seen as a sign of success. But it can also be a meaningful way
                                    to express your individuality.</p>
